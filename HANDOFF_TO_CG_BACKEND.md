**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**From:** Alex Siegel - CRM Team  
**To:** CuraGenesis Backend/API Team  
**Subject:** Practice Submission Integration - Production Ready

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The **CuraGenesis CRM** is now successfully submitting practice data to your external API endpoint. This document explains what we're doing, what data we're sending, and what you need to do with it.

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ Integration Working - HTTP 200 Success

---

## üìã WHAT IS THE CRM?

The CuraGenesis CRM is a **sales intake system** for our field sales team (reps/agents). It allows reps to:

1. **Capture practice information** during sales calls/meetings
2. **Collect practice details** (name, NPI, address, contacts, etc.)
3. **Submit practices to your system** for onboarding
4. **Track submission status** and follow up

**Goal:** Get practices enrolled in CuraGenesis faster by having reps pre-populate their information.

---

## üîÑ THE WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Sales Rep Collects Practice Info (CRM)
- Rep meets with practice (doctor's office, clinic, etc.)
- Rep enters practice details into CRM:
  - Practice name, specialty, NPI, TIN
  - Contact person (usually office manager or doctor)
  - Address, phone, email
  - Primary contact name and position

### Step 2: Rep Submits to CuraGenesis (CRM ‚Üí Your API)
- Rep clicks "Send to Practice" in CRM
- CRM calls: `POST https://ix0n88n8ze.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/admin_createUserWithBaa`
- Sends complete practice data as JSON

### Step 3: Your System Processes (Your Responsibility)
**What you should do:**
1. ‚úÖ **Create practice user account** in your database
2. ‚úÖ **Generate magic link** for practice onboarding
3. ‚úÖ **Send welcome email** to practice contact with magic link
4. ‚úÖ **Return success** with userId

**What you should NOT do:**
- ‚ùå Don't create WorkMail accounts (practices don't need @curagenesis.com emails)
- ‚ùå Don't create internal system accounts (that's for reps only)

### Step 4: Practice Completes Onboarding (Your Portal)
- Practice contact receives email with magic link
- Clicks link ‚Üí Goes to your onboarding portal
- Completes profile, signs BAA, adds payment info
- Becomes active customer

## üéØ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### 1. Create Practice User Account
When you receive a practice submission:

```javascript
// Pseudocode
const practice = requestBody.practice;
const rep = requestBody.rep;

// Create user in your Auth0/Cognito/database
const userId = await createUser({
  email: practice.email || requestBody.primaryContactEmail,
  firstName: extractFirstName(requestBody.primaryContactName),
  lastName: extractLastName(requestBody.primaryContactName),
  userType: 'PRACTICE',
  practiceInfo: {
    name: practice.name,
    npi: practice.npi_org,
    tin: practice.ein_tin,
    specialty: practice.specialty,
    address: practice.address,
    phone: practice.phone
  },
  metadata: {
    submittedBy: rep.email,
    submittedByRepId: rep.id,
    submittedAt: requestBody.submitted_at,
    sourceSystem: 'intake_crm'
  }
});
```

### 2. Generate Magic Link
```javascript
const token = generateSecureToken();
const magicLink = `https://portal.curagenesis.com/onboard?token=${token}`;

await saveMagicLinkToken({
  userId,
  token,
  expiresAt: Date.now() + (72 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 72 hours
});
```

### 3. Send Welcome Email to Practice
**Send to:** `practice.email` or the first contact's email

**Email content should include:**
- Welcome message
- Practice name and details (for verification)
- Magic link to complete onboarding
- Expiration notice (72 hours)
- Support contact

**Example:**
```
Subject: Complete Your CuraGenesis Account Setup - [Practice Name]

Hi [Primary Contact Name],

Your CuraGenesis account has been set up by your sales representative [Rep Name].

Practice: [Practice Name]
Contact: [Primary Contact Name] - [Position]

Click the link below to complete your onboarding:
[Magic Link - expires in 72 hours]

During onboarding you'll:
- Verify your practice information
- Sign Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
- Set up your account credentials
- Add payment information

Questions? Contact: support@curagenesis.com

Thanks,
CuraGenesis Team
```

### 4. Return Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Practice account created successfully",
  "data": {
    "userId": "auth0|abc123",
    "practiceId": "FAC-XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ",
    "magicLinkSent": true,
    "emailSentTo": "contact@practice.com"
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### DO NOT Create WorkMail Accounts
- ‚ùå **Practices** do NOT need @curagenesis.com email addresses
- ‚ùå **Practices** use their own business email
- ‚úÖ **Only internal reps/agents** get @curagenesis.com WorkMail accounts
- ‚úÖ **WorkMail creation** happens in Admin ‚Üí Recruitment tool (separate endpoint)

### Handle Duplicates
- Check if practice.email or practice.npi_org already exists
- Return 409 Conflict if duplicate found
- Include details about existing practice in error response

### Store Sales Rep Attribution
**CRITICAL:** Track which rep submitted each practice!

```sql
-- Your practice/facilities table should have:
ALTER TABLE practices ADD COLUMN submitted_by_rep_email VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE practices ADD COLUMN submitted_by_rep_id VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE practices ADD COLUMN submitted_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE practices ADD COLUMN source_system VARCHAR(50);
```

**Why this matters:**
- Commission tracking (reps get paid for practices they sign up)
- Performance metrics (which reps are most successful)
- Support routing (route questions to the rep who knows the practice)
- Relationship management (rep owns the practice account)

## üö® CURRENT ISSUE TO FIX

### WorkMail Creation Errors
Your Lambda is currently trying to create WorkMail accounts and failing:

```
Failed to create practice WorkMail account: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND workmail.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
Failed to create rep WorkMail account: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND workmail.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

**Fix Required:**
1. **Remove WorkMail creation code** from this Lambda
2. **Only send the magic link email** to the practice contact
3. **WorkMail accounts** are created separately via Admin ‚Üí Recruitment tool (for internal reps only)

### Why Practices Don't Need WorkMail
- Practices are **external customers**
- They use their own business email addresses
- They don't need @curagenesis.com emails
- Only internal employees (reps, agents, admin) get WorkMail

---

## üìß EMAIL REQUIREMENTS

### Who Receives the Email?
Send to: `practice.email` (primary) or first contact's email

### What Should the Email Contain?

```

---

---

This email was sent to [practice.email] because your practice was registered 
by [rep.name] on [submitted_at].
```

### Email Template Variables
Use these fields from the payload:
- `practice.name` - Practice name
- `practice.specialty` - Specialty
- `practice.city`, `practice.state` - Location
- `primaryContactName` - Person to address email to
- `primaryContactPosition` - Their role/title
- `rep.name` - Sales rep who submitted
- `rep.email` - Rep's contact email
- `submitted_at` - When it was submitted

---

## üîê SECURITY & DATA HANDLING

### Idempotency
- We send `Idempotency-Key` header with each request
- Use this to prevent duplicate submissions
- If you receive the same key twice, return the original response

### Data Retention
- **Store the rep attribution** (rep.id, rep.email) with each practice
- This is critical for commission tracking and support
- Don't discard this data

### Validation
**You should validate:**
- ‚úÖ `practice.name` is present and non-empty
- ‚úÖ `practice.email` is valid email format
- ‚úÖ `practice.state` is valid 2-letter US state code
- ‚úÖ `practice.npi_org` is 10 digits (if provided)
- ‚úÖ `practice.ein_tin` is 9 digits (if provided)
- ‚úÖ `rep.email` is a valid @curagenesis.com email

**Return specific validation errors:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": {
    "practice.email": "Invalid email format",
    "practice.npi_org": "NPI must be exactly 10 digits"
  }
}
```

---

## üìä WHAT WE TRACK IN CRM

After you respond, we store:
- Submission status (SUCCESS or FAILED)
- HTTP status code
- Your response data (userId, etc.)
- Timestamp
- Any error messages

This helps reps:
- See which practices are pending onboarding
- Follow up with practices who haven't completed setup
- Track their pipeline

---

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

### What Success Looks Like
1. ‚úÖ CRM submits practice ‚Üí HTTP 200 response
2. ‚úÖ Practice user created in your database
3. ‚úÖ Magic link email sent to practice contact
4. ‚úÖ Practice receives email within 2 minutes
5. ‚úÖ Practice clicks link and completes onboarding
6. ‚úÖ Practice becomes active customer
7. ‚úÖ Rep gets credit for the sale

### Common Failure Scenarios
- **409 Duplicate** - Practice already exists (check by email or NPI)
- **400 Validation** - Missing required fields or invalid format
- **500 Server Error** - Your backend issue
- **503 Unavailable** - Your service is down

**We handle all these gracefully** and show appropriate messages to reps.
