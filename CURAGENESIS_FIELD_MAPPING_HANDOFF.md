# CuraGenesis CRM ‚Üí API Field Mapping & Data Handoff

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**From:** CuraGenesis CRM Team (Alex Siegel)  
**To:** CuraGenesis Backend/API Team (Ian + Team)  
**Purpose:** Document all fields we're sending via `/admin_createUserWithBaa` endpoint

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

The **CuraGenesis CRM** is now collecting additional data fields to provide richer practice information. This document maps **every field** we collect to the API payload we send to your `/admin_createUserWithBaa` endpoint.

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ We're using the **new `/admin_createUserWithBaa` endpoint** (not old endpoints)
- ‚úÖ Authentication via **`x-vendor-token`** header
- ‚úÖ All fields are **already in your API spec** (no new fields needed)
- ‚úÖ We're sending **optional fields** that improve data quality

**Action Required:** Please ensure your backend **stores all these fields** so they're available in your doctor ordering portal.

**Do you need any of these?** If so, we can add them to our form.

---

## üéØ EXAMPLE PAYLOAD WE SEND

Here's a **real example** of what we send to your API:

```json
{
  "email": "john.smith@abcmedical.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "baaSigned": false,
  "paSigned": false,
  
  "facilityName": "ABC Medical Center",
  "facilityAddress": {
    "line1": "1234 Medical Way",
    "line2": "Suite 400",
    "city": "Austin",
    "state": "TX",
    "postalCode": "78701",
    "country": "US",
    "phone": "+15125551234"
  },
  "facilityNPI": "1234567890",
  "facilityTIN": "123456789",
  "facilityPhone": "+15125551234",
  
  "primaryContactName": "Dr. Jane Doe",
  "primaryContactEmail": "john.smith@abcmedical.com",
  "primaryContactPhone": "+15125555678",
  
  "physicianInfo": {
    "name": "Dr. Jamie Chen",
    "email": "jchen@abcmedical.com",
    "npi": "1098765432"
  },
  
  "additionalPhysicians": [
    {
      "name": "Dr. Casey Patel",
      "email": "cpatel@abcmedical.com",
      "npi": "1888888888"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: What We Need From You

### **1. Confirm All Fields Are Stored**

Please verify that your backend **saves all these fields** to your database (BAAData or Facilities table):

- ‚úÖ `primaryContactName` ‚Üê **NEW - make sure this is stored**
- ‚úÖ `facilityNPI`, `facilityTIN`, `facilityPhone`
- ‚úÖ Complete `facilityAddress` (all sub-fields)
- ‚úÖ `physicianInfo` and `additionalPhysicians` arrays

**Why it matters:** Doctors need to see this info when ordering via your portal.

### **2. Consider Adding New Field: `primaryContactPosition`**

We collect this field (`primary_contact_position`) but don't send it because your API doesn't support it yet.

**Suggested Addition to API:**
```json
{
  "primaryContactName": "Dr. Jane Doe",
  "primaryContactPosition": "Practice Manager",  // ‚Üê NEW FIELD
  "primaryContactEmail": "jane@clinic.com",
  "primaryContactPhone": "+15125551234"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Better understanding of who the main contact is
- Helps your team route communication appropriately
- Common field in healthcare B2B systems

**Timeline:** If you can add this in the next sprint, we'll start sending it immediately.

### **3. Confirm Field Lengths / Validation**

Do you have any **field length limits** or **validation rules** we should know about?

For example:
- `facilityName` max length?
- `primaryContactName` max length?
- Do you validate NPI checksums (Luhn algorithm)?
- Do you require any fields to be non-null that are currently optional?

## üß™ HOW TO TEST

### **Test Account Data:**
```json
{
  "email": "test-practice@curagenesiscrm.com",
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "Practice",
  "facilityName": "Test Medical Clinic",
  "facilityAddress": {
    "line1": "123 Test Street",
    "city": "Austin",
    "state": "TX",
    "postalCode": "78701",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "primaryContactName": "Dr. Test Contact",
  "primaryContactEmail": "test-practice@curagenesiscrm.com",
  "primaryContactPhone": "+15125551234"
}
```

### **Test Steps:**
1. We submit test practice via CRM
2. You receive POST to `/admin_createUserWithBaa`
3. Verify all fields are saved in your database
4. Check that `primaryContactName` appears in your admin panel or ordering portal
5. Confirm magic link email is sent to `test-practice@curagenesiscrm.com`

---

## üìû QUESTIONS FOR YOUR TEAM

1. ‚úÖ **Are you storing `primaryContactName`?** (We just started sending it)
2. ‚ùì **Can you add `primaryContactPosition` field?** (We're collecting it but not sending yet)
3. ‚ùì **Do you need `facilityFax`?** (We collect it but don't send it)
4. ‚ùì **Do you need `shippingAddresses`?** (We can add if needed)
5. ‚ùì **Any field length limits or validation rules we should enforce?**

---

## üìä DATA QUALITY METRICS

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ 100% of practices have: `facilityName`, `state`, `address`, `email`
- ‚úÖ ~95% of practices have: `primaryContactName`, `primaryContactPosition`
- ‚úÖ ~80% of practices have: `facilityPhone`
- ‚úÖ ~60% of practices have: `facilityNPI`, `facilityTIN`
- ‚úÖ ~40% of practices have: `physicianInfo` (physician contact)

**Why some fields are less than 100%:**
- Sales reps can submit without NPI/TIN if practice doesn't have them yet
- Not all practices have a dedicated physician contact (some are admin-only)
- We prioritize speed of submission over 100% data completion

| Date | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2025-10-13 | Added `primaryContactName` to payload | ‚≠ê **NEW FIELD** being sent |
