# 🔒 Rep Data Scoping Fix - CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Issue:** Reps were seeing company-wide data instead of only their own  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready to Deploy

---

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

**User Report:**
> "asiegel (rep account) has no sales but is seeing company-wide metrics on the dashboard. Reps should only see THEIR OWN data, not aggregate company data."

**Root Cause:**
- KPI API endpoints were NOT filtering data by user role
- All users (admins AND reps) were receiving company-wide metrics
- Critical data scoping vulnerability

---

## ✅ **Files Fixed**

### **API Routes Updated (5 files):**

1. **`src/app/api/kpi/overview/route.ts`**
   - Added `getCurrentUser()` to get current user
   - Pass `repEmail` to calculator if user is AGENT
   - Admins see all data; agents see only their own

2. **`src/app/api/kpi/segments/route.ts`**
   - Same filtering logic as overview
   - Agents see only their own segment data

3. **`src/app/api/kpi/geo/route.ts`**
   - Geographic data filtered by rep
   - Agents see only states where they have accounts

4. **`src/app/api/kpi/territory/route.ts`**
   - Territory metrics filtered by rep
   - Agents see only their own territory

5. **`src/app/api/kpi/leaderboard/route.ts`**
   - Already had filtering ✅ (no changes needed)

### **Metrics Calculator Updated (1 file):**

**`src/lib/metrics-calculator.ts`**

Updated 4 functions to accept optional `repEmail` parameter:
- ✅ `calculateOverviewMetrics(dateRange, repEmail?)`
- ✅ `calculateSegmentMetrics(dateRange, repEmail?)`
- ✅ `calculateGeoMetrics(dateRange, repEmail?)`
- ✅ `calculateTerritoryMetrics(dateRange, repEmail?)`

**Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
// If repEmail provided (agent), filter to only that rep's data
const [facilities, allOrders] = await Promise.all([
  repEmail ? getFacilitiesByRep(repEmail) : getAllFacilities(),
  getAllOrders(),
]);

// For agents, only include orders from their facilities
const facilityUserIds = new Set(facilities.map(f => f.UserId));
const orders = repEmail 
  ? allOrders.filter(o => facilityUserIds.has(o.userId))
  : allOrders;
```

## 🔐 **Security Impact**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ All users saw company-wide revenue
- ❌ All users saw total orders across all reps
- ❌ All users saw all customer data
- ❌ Reps could see competitor rep performance

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Admins see all company data (unchanged)
- ✅ Agents see ONLY their assigned accounts
- ✅ Agents see ONLY orders from their accounts
- ✅ Zero data leakage between reps

---

## 📊 **Expected Behavior After Deploy**

### **Admin User:**
- Sees all practices
- Sees all orders
- Sees all reps in leaderboard
- Sees company-wide metrics

### **Agent/Rep User (e.g., asiegel@curagenesis.com):**
- Sees ONLY practices assigned to them
- Sees ONLY orders from their practices
- Sees ONLY their own row in leaderboard
- **If no sales:** All metrics show **ZEROS**

---

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

After deploying, verify:

### **Test as Admin:**
- [ ] Dashboard shows company-wide data
- [ ] Multiple reps appear in Team leaderboard
- [ ] Financial metrics visible
- [ ] All KPI cards show non-zero values

### **Test as Rep (asiegel):**
- [ ] Dashboard shows ONLY asiegel's data
- [ ] If no assigned accounts: **All zeros**
- [ ] Leaderboard shows ONLY asiegel's row
- [ ] Cannot see other reps' data
- [ ] Geographic data filtered to only their states

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "SECURITY FIX: Implement rep-level data scoping for KPIs"
   git push origin ecs
   ```

2. **Build & Deploy:**
   - Docker image will rebuild automatically
   - ECS will pull new image
   - Wait ~3-5 minutes for deployment

3. **Test immediately:**
   - Login as admin → Verify company data
   - Login as asiegel → Verify only his data (or zeros)
