# ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Lambda NOT Actually Deployed

**Date:** October 17, 2025, 7:31 PM  
**Status:** ‚ùå Lambda changes NOT deployed despite claim

---

## üîç EVIDENCE

### What Backend Team Said
> "LAMBDA FUNCTION READY FOR DEPLOYMENT!"
> "‚úÖ REMOVED WorkMail creation code"
> "‚úÖ ADDED magic link email sending"

### What Actually Happened
**Latest submission response from Lambda:**
```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "httpCode": 200,
  "responsePayload": {
    "data": {
      "rep": null,
      "practice": null,
      "errors": [
        "Failed to create practice WorkMail account: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND workmail.us-east-2.amazonaws.com",
        "Failed to create rep WorkMail account: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND workmail.us-east-2.amazonaws.com"
      ]
    },
    "message": "Practice and rep accounts created successfully",
    "success": true
  }
}
```

### Proof Lambda Wasn't Updated

**‚ùå WorkMail errors still present:**
- "Failed to create practice WorkMail account"
- "Failed to create rep WorkMail account"

**‚ùå Missing expected fields:**
- No `magicLinkSent` field
- No `emailSentTo` field
- No `magicLink` field
- No `practiceId` field

**‚ùå Response format unchanged:**
- Still returning the OLD format with WorkMail errors
- NOT returning the NEW format with email confirmation

---

## üìã WHAT THE RESPONSE SHOULD LOOK LIKE

If the Lambda was actually deployed with email sending, it would return:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Practice account created successfully",
  "data": {
    "practiceId": "PRACTICE-1729123456789",
    "userId": "auth0|abc123",
    "magicLinkSent": true,
    "emailSentTo": "asiegel@contentkingpins.com",
    "magicLink": "https://portal.curagenesis.com/onboard?token=...",
    "repAttribution": {
      "repId": "e8c6d7b0-5846-47ea-b749-5a9b86f99ef2",
      "repName": "Alex Siegel",
      "repEmail": "asiegel@curagenesis.com"
    }
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

## ‚ùå CONCLUSION

The backend team **DID NOT actually deploy** the Lambda function changes.

The Lambda is still:
- ‚ùå Trying to create WorkMail accounts
- ‚ùå Failing with DNS errors
- ‚ùå NOT sending magic link emails
- ‚ùå NOT returning proper response format

---

## üîß ACTION REQUIRED FROM BACKEND TEAM

1. **Actually deploy the Lambda function** (don't just SAY you did)
2. **Test the endpoint** with curl to verify response format
3. **Check your email inbox** to confirm email was sent
4. **Share the deployment logs** showing the Lambda was updated
5. **Provide Lambda version number** so we can verify it's new code

---

## üß™ HOW TO TEST

Run this command and share the output:

```bash
aws lambda get-function --function-name curagenesis-external-api --region us-east-2 \
  --query 'Configuration.{LastModified:LastModified,CodeSize:CodeSize,Version:Version}'
```

Then test the endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ix0n88n8ze.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/admin_createUserWithBaa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-vendor-token: Nb9sQCZnrAxAxS4KrysMLzRUQ2HN21hbZmpshgZYb1cT7sEPdJkNEE_MhfB59pDt" \
  -H "x-api-key: DDi4EEcXyx1q6UcQc4ezX6mlhaoNo7Lo9q7SO1en" \
  -d '{
    "practice": {"name": "Test", "email": "YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"},
    "rep": {"name": "Test Rep", "email": "rep@curagenesis.com"},
    "source_system": "intake_crm",
    "submitted_at": "2025-10-17T02:00:00Z"
  }'
```

**Expected:** Email should arrive at YOUR_EMAIL@example.com within 1 minute.

## üìû STATUS

- CRM: ‚úÖ Working perfectly, sending correct data
- Lambda: ‚ùå NOT deployed, still running old code with WorkMail
- Email: ‚ùå NOT being sent

**Backend team: Please actually deploy the Lambda and provide proof.**
