# Rep-Scoped Accounts with Admin Assignment - Implemented âœ…

## Overview

Complete implementation of role-based account access with admin assignment features.

---

## âœ… What's Implemented:

### 1. Database Schema âœ…
**Prisma Models**:
- `Account.ownerRepId` - Links account to rep (already existed)
- `Account.ownerRep` - Relation to User
- `AccountAssignment` - NEW: Audit trail for assignments

**Migration Applied**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE account_assignments (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  rep_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  assigned_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. API Endpoints âœ…

#### `/api/accounts` (GET) - Role-Based Filtering
**Behavior**:
- **Admins**: See ALL accounts
- **Reps**: See ONLY accounts where `ownerRepId = their user ID`

**Query Parameters**:
- `q` - Search by practice name, city, state
- `status` - Filter by account status
- `take` - Pagination limit (default: 50)
- `skip` - Pagination offset

**Response**:
```json
{
  "accounts": [...],
  "total": 45,
  "take": 50,
  "skip": 0,
  "isFiltered": false
}
```

#### `/api/accounts/[id]/assign` (PATCH) - Admin Only
**Assigns/reassigns account to a rep**

**Request**:
```json
{
  "repId": "user-uuid"
}
```

**Features**:
- Admin-only access (`requireAdmin()`)
- Validates rep exists and is active
- Updates `ownerRepId`
- Creates audit trail entry
- Returns updated account

#### `/api/users` (GET) - Rep Listing
**Query Parameters**:
- `role=agent` - Get all active reps (for admin dropdown)

**Behavior**:
- **Admins**: Get all users (or filtered by role)
- **Reps**: Get only themselves

**Response**:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "name": "Alex Siegel",
      "email": "asiegel@curagenesis.com",
      "role": "AGENT",
      "active": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. UI Components âœ…

#### `AssignRep` Component
**Location**: `src/components/accounts/AssignRep.tsx`

**Features**:
- Only visible to admins
- Dropdown of active reps
- Real-time assignment
- Success/error feedback
- Optimistic UI updates

**Usage**:
```tsx
<AssignRep
  accountId={account.id}
  currentRepId={account.ownerRep?.id}
/>
```

#### Integration in Accounts List
**Location**: `src/components/intake/accounts-list.tsx`

**Behavior**:
- **Admins**: See dropdown to assign/reassign rep
- **Reps**: See read-only rep name

## ðŸ”’ Security Implementation:

### API Layer:
- âœ… `/api/accounts` - Filters by `ownerRepId` for non-admins
- âœ… `/api/accounts/[id]/assign` - Requires admin role
- âœ… `/api/users` - Returns filtered list based on role

### Client Layer:
- âœ… AssignRep component - Only renders for admins
- âœ… Accounts list - Shows different UI for admins vs reps

### Audit Trail:
- âœ… All assignments logged to `account_assignments`
- âœ… Tracks: accountId, repId, assignedBy, timestamp

---

## ðŸ“Š User Credentials Created:

### Admin:
- **Email**: admin@curagenesis.com
- **Password**: Money100!
- **Role**: ADMIN
- **Can**: See all accounts, assign to any rep

### Rep:
- **Email**: asiegel@curagenesis.com
- **Password**: Money100!
- **Role**: AGENT  
- **Can**: See only assigned accounts

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios:

### Test 1: Rep Creates Account
1. Login as asiegel@curagenesis.com
2. Go to Intake
3. Create new account
4. `ownerRepId` should be set to asiegel's user ID
5. Account appears in their list

### Test 2: Admin Sees All
1. Login as admin@curagenesis.com
2. Go to Intake
3. Should see ALL accounts (including asiegel's)

### Test 3: Rep Sees Only Own
1. Login as asiegel@curagenesis.com
2. Go to Intake
3. Should see ONLY accounts assigned to them
4. Should NOT see admin's accounts or unassigned accounts

### Test 4: Admin Assigns Account
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Intake
3. Click dropdown on any account
4. Select a rep
5. Account now assigned to that rep
6. Audit entry created

### Test 5: Reassignment
1. Admin reassigns account from Rep A to Rep B
2. Rep A loses access (can't see it anymore)
3. Rep B gains access (now sees it)
4. Audit trail shows both assignments

**Includes**:
- âœ… Rep-scoped account filtering
