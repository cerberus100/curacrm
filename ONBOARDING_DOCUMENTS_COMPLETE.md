# 🎉 Complete Onboarding + Library Documents System - DEPLOYED!

## ✅ Status: LIVE v8 (Task Definition 15)

**What You Asked For**: 
> "besides sending documents i want them stored and labeled in that section where it shows onboarding it should be the documents we upload so we can add or remove them as we update or add new things"

**What We Built**: A complete dual document system with both onboarding AND library documents working together!

---

## 🎯 Two Document Systems in One

### 1. **Onboarding Documents** (NEW!)
**Purpose**: Reps upload required documents for compliance

**Admin Can**:
- Define what documents ALL reps must upload
- Add new document types (e.g., "Background Check", "Insurance Cert")
- Remove document types that are no longer needed
- See which reps have completed their documents

**Reps Can**:
- See list of required documents
- Upload files for each requirement
- Re-upload if they need to update
- Track status (Pending, Submitted, Signed)

**Built-In Document Types**:
- W-9 Tax Form
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
- Independent Contractor Agreement
- Plus any custom types admin adds!

### 2. **Library Documents** (From v6/v7)
**Purpose**: Admin shares company documents WITH reps

**Admin Can**:
- Upload company documents (policies, training materials, etc.)
- Send to specific reps or all reps
- Track who has viewed what
- Delete outdated documents

**Reps Can**:
- View documents shared with them
- Download documents
- System tracks when they viewed it
