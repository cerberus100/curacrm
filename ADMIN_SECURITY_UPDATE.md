# Admin Security & Access Control Update

## ‚úÖ What I've Fixed

### 1. **Documents Page Error**
- Fixed the database import issue (`db` ‚Üí `prisma`)
- Added mock documents data for demo purposes
- The Documents page should now load without errors

### 2. **Admin-Only Protection**
- Created `auth-helpers.ts` with:
  - `getCurrentUser()` - Gets current user from cookies
  - `requireAdmin()` - Enforces admin-only access
  - `requireAuth()` - Enforces authentication
- Added admin check to `/api/kpi/sync-practices` endpoint

### 3. **Dashboard User Context**
- Added `useCurrentUser` hook to Dashboard component
- Set up foundation for role-based UI rendering

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. **Enable Authentication Middleware**
Currently, the middleware is in demo mode. To enable proper authentication:

```typescript
// In src/middleware.ts
// Remove line 22: return NextResponse.next();
// Uncomment the production auth logic (lines 24-58)
```

### 2. **Hide Sensitive Dashboard Tabs for Non-Admins**
The dashboard currently shows all tabs to all users. To restrict:
- **Team Tab**: Should only show to admins (shows rep performance)
- **Practices Tab**: Should only show to admins (shows all company data)
- **Segments Tab**: Should only show to admins (shows company-wide metrics)

Non-admin users (agents) should only see:
- **Overview Tab**: With limited data (their own stats only)

### 3. **Create Agent-Specific Views**
For non-admin users, you need:
- Personal performance metrics only
- Their own submissions and accounts
- No access to other reps' data

## üîí Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Enable the authentication middleware** (currently bypassed for demo)
2. **Add role checks to all sensitive API endpoints**:
   - `/api/kpi/*` - Admin only
   - `/api/admin/*` - Admin only
   - `/api/accounts` - Filter by rep for non-admins

### Database-Level Security
Consider adding Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
```sql
-- Example: Agents can only see their own accounts
CREATE POLICY agent_account_policy ON accounts
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    auth.role() = 'ADMIN' OR 
    owner_rep_id = auth.user_id()
  );
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Test the deployed changes**:
   - Documents page should work now
   - Practice sync requires admin role

2. **Complete the dashboard restrictions**:
   - Hide admin-only tabs from agents
   - Filter data based on user role

3. **Enable production authentication**:
   - Remove demo mode from middleware
   - Test full auth flow

The foundation is in place - you just need to enable the middleware and complete the UI restrictions based on the `isAdmin` flag that's now available in the dashboard component.
