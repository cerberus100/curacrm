# Reactivation Features - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Overview

Implemented admin and rep reactivation features with proper audit trails and access controls.

---

## Feature 1: Reactivate Rep (Admin-only) âœ…

### Database Changes:
- Added `suspension_reason` column to `users` table
- Stores reason when deactivating a rep
- Cleared automatically on reactivation

### API Endpoint:
**POST /api/reps/[id]/status**
- Admin-only access (`requireAdmin()`)
- Request body: `{ active: boolean, reason?: string }`
- Last-admin guard: Cannot deactivate the last active admin (returns 400)
- Returns updated user with active status and suspension reason

### UI Updates:
- Active/Inactive toggle switch on Rep detail page
- Prompts for optional reason when deactivating
- Displays suspension reason below toggle when inactive
- Toast/alert confirmation on status change

### Security:
- âœ… Non-admin receives 403
- âœ… Last admin cannot be deactivated (400 error)
- âœ… Reactivated rep can log in immediately (subject to onboarding gate)
- âœ… Audit trail maintained with reason

---

## Feature 2: Reactivate Account/Practice âœ…

### Database Changes:
- Extended `AccountStatus` enum with: `DORMANT`, `CLOSED`
- Created `activities` table for timeline tracking:
  - account_id (foreign key)
  - user_id (who performed action)
  - type (reactivation, note, status_change)
  - subject
  - body (optional details)
  - created_at

### API Endpoint:
**POST /api/accounts/[id]/reactivate**
- Access: Admin OR owning rep (`requireRepOrAdmin()`)
- Request body: `{ note?: string }`
- Only works on accounts with status: DORMANT or CLOSED
- Returns error 400 if trying to reactivate already-active account
- Creates activity log entry on success

### Security & Row-Level Access:
- âœ… Reps can only reactivate accounts they own
- âœ… Admins can reactivate any account
- âœ… Returns 403 if rep tries to reactivate another rep's account
- âœ… Returns 400 if account is not DORMANT or CLOSED

### Audit Trail:
- Activity record created with:
  - Who reactivated (user_id)
  - When (created_at)
  - Optional note
  - Type: "reactivation"
  - Subject: "Account reactivated"

## QA Verification Results:

### Reps Reactivation:
```bash
âœ… /app/api/reps/[id]/status route exists
âœ… suspensionReason in prisma schema
âœ… requireAdmin guards in place
```

### Accounts Reactivation:
```bash
âœ… /app/api/accounts/[id]/reactivate route exists
âœ… AccountStatus enum includes DORMANT, CLOSED
âœ… requireRepOrAdmin guard in place
âœ… Activity model for timeline tracking
```

### Access Control:
```bash
âœ… Admin-only for rep status changes
âœ… Rep OR Admin for account reactivation
âœ… Row-level permissions enforced
âœ… Last-admin guard implemented
```
