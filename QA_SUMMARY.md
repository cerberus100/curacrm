## ⚠️ Minor Gaps (3/47 - Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Missing Confirmation Modal
**Status:** Not blocking  
**What:** No "Are you sure?" dialog before sending  
**Fix Effort:** 1 hour  
**Priority:** Low (can add later)

### 2. No Duplicate Pre-Check
**Status:** Optional feature  
**What:** No NPI/phone duplicate warning on blur  
**Fix Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** Low (DB uniqueness prevents actual duplicates)

### 3. .env.example Blocked
**Status:** Documented workaround  
**What:** File blocked by globalIgnore  
**Fix:** Manually create or use README instructions  
**Priority:** Low (README has full template)

## 🚀 Ready to Test

### Test URL
**http://localhost:30003**

### Test Flow
1. Login (any credentials) → Dashboard
2. Intake → Create Account → Add Contact → Save
3. Send to CuraGenesis (will fail without real API key, but logs properly)
4. View Submissions → See request/response
5. Check KPI Dashboard (shows error without real keys)

### What Works Without API Keys
- ✅ All UI/UX interactions
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Database operations
- ✅ Phone formatting
- ✅ Navigation
- ✅ Submissions logging

### What Requires Real API Keys
- ❌ Successful CuraGenesis sends
- ❌ KPI metrics loading
