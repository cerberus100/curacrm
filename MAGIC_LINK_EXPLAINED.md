# Magic Link - What It Is and Why We Need It

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Audience:** CuraGenesis Backend Team

## üéØ WHAT IS A MAGIC LINK?

A **magic link** is a **passwordless authentication URL** sent to a user's email that allows them to:
- Verify their email address
- Complete account setup
- Access their account without creating a password first

**Example:**
```
https://portal.curagenesis.com/onboard?token=11l8yup99aoh71gmzldzshog0q29mjc41n
```

## üîÑ WHY WE NEED IT

### The Problem Without Magic Links
When a sales rep signs up a practice, the practice contact would need to:
1. Wait for the rep to tell them about CuraGenesis
2. Go to the website and click "Sign Up"
3. Fill out all their information again (duplicate work!)
4. Create a password
5. Verify email
6. Complete onboarding

**This is slow, creates friction, and many practices never complete it.**

### The Solution With Magic Links
When a sales rep signs up a practice through the CRM:
1. ‚úÖ Rep pre-fills all practice information
2. ‚úÖ Practice receives email immediately with magic link
3. ‚úÖ Practice clicks link ‚Üí goes directly to onboarding (already logged in!)
4. ‚úÖ Practice reviews info, signs BAA, adds payment
5. ‚úÖ Practice is active and can start ordering

**This is fast, seamless, and has much higher completion rates.**

## üîê HOW MAGIC LINKS WORK

### 1. Generate Secure Token
When CRM submits a practice, your Lambda generates a unique token:

```javascript
const token = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
// Result: "11l8yup99aoh71gmzldzshog0q29mjc41n"
```

### 2. Store Token in Database
Link the token to the practice user:

```javascript
await db.magicLinks.create({
  token: "11l8yup99aoh71gmzldzshog0q29mjc41n",
  userId: "practice-user-123",
  expiresAt: Date.now() + (72 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 72 hours
  used: false
});
```

### 3. Send Email with Magic Link
Email contains the link:

```
Click here to complete your CuraGenesis setup:
https://portal.curagenesis.com/onboard?token=11l8yup99aoh71gmzldzshog0q29mjc41n
```

### 4. Practice Clicks Link
When they click:
1. Browser goes to: `https://portal.curagenesis.com/onboard?token=11l8yup99aoh71gmzldzshog0q29mjc41n`
2. Your portal backend receives the token
3. Validates token exists and hasn't expired
4. Logs the user in automatically
5. Shows onboarding form with pre-filled data
6. Marks token as "used" so it can't be reused

## üîí SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### Token Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Long and random** (at least 32 bytes)
- ‚úÖ **Cryptographically secure** (use crypto.randomBytes, NOT Math.random)
- ‚úÖ **One-time use** (mark as used after first click)
- ‚úÖ **Time-limited** (expire after 72 hours)
- ‚úÖ **URL-safe** (hex encoding is safe)

### What to Validate
When someone visits `/onboard?token=...`:

1. **Check token exists** in database
   ```javascript
   const link = await db.magicLinks.findOne({ token });
   if (!link) return error("Invalid link");
   ```

2. **Check not expired**
   ```javascript
   if (link.expiresAt < Date.now()) return error("Link expired");
   ```

3. **Check not already used**
   ```javascript
   if (link.used) return error("Link already used");
   ```

4. **Auto-login the user**
   ```javascript
   const session = await createSession(link.userId);
   setCookie('auth-token', session.token);
   ```

5. **Mark as used**
   ```javascript
   await db.magicLinks.update({ token }, { used: true });
   ```

6. **Show onboarding form**
   - Pre-fill practice data
   - Let them review and confirm
   - Sign BAA
   - Add payment info
   - Activate account

## üéØ WHY THIS MATTERS FOR SALES

### Without Magic Links (Old Way)
- Sales rep pitches practice
- Practice says "I'll think about it"
- Rep sends follow-up email
- Practice goes to website, sees signup form
- **50% drop off** - they don't bother filling it out again
- Rep has to follow up multiple times
- Slow conversion

### With Magic Links (New Way)
- Sales rep pitches practice
- Rep fills out info in CRM while on call
- Practice receives email **immediately**
- Practice clicks link, sees **their info already filled in**
- Practice just reviews, signs, and adds payment
- **90% completion rate** - much higher conversion
- Faster time to first order
- Happy sales reps (they get credit immediately)

## üìä EXPECTED FLOW

### Step 1: Sales Rep in CRM
```
Rep fills out:
- Practice: "Sunshine Medical"
- Contact: "Dr. Sarah Johnson" <sarah@sunshinemedical.com>
- Specialty: Family Medicine
- Location: Austin, TX
- NPI, TIN, address, phone, etc.

Rep clicks: "Send to Practice"
```

### Step 2: Your Lambda Receives
```json
{
  "practice": {
    "name": "Sunshine Medical",
    "email": "sarah@sunshinemedical.com",
    ...
  },
  "rep": {
    "name": "Alex Siegel",
    "email": "asiegel@curagenesis.com"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Your Lambda Does
```javascript
1. Create practice user in database
2. Generate magic link token
3. Store token with userId and expiry
4. Send email to sarah@sunshinemedical.com with magic link
5. Return success with practiceId, magicLink, etc.
```

### Step 4: Practice Contact Receives Email
```
From: noreply@curagenesis.com
To: sarah@sunshinemedical.com
Subject: Complete Your CuraGenesis Account - Sunshine Medical

[Email with magic link button]
```

### Step 5: Practice Clicks Link
```
Browser opens: https://portal.curagenesis.com/onboard?token=abc123...
Your portal backend:
1. Validates token
2. Auto-logs them in
3. Shows onboarding form with pre-filled data
4. They review, sign BAA, add payment
5. Account activated!
```

### Step 6: Practice is Active
- Can log in to portal
- Can browse products
- Can place orders
- Rep gets credit for the sale

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT ISSUE

Your Lambda returns `"magicLinkSent": false` which means:
- ‚úÖ You're generating the token
- ‚úÖ You're creating the practice
- ‚ùå **You're NOT actually sending the email**

**Why?**
Probably one of:
1. SES is not verified for sender email (`noreply@curagenesis.com`)
2. SES region is wrong
3. Email sending code isn't actually being executed
4. Email is failing silently

**Fix:**
1. Verify sender email in SES:
   ```bash
   aws ses verify-email-identity --email-address noreply@curagenesis.com --region us-east-2
   ```
2. Check verification:
   ```bash
   aws ses list-verified-email-addresses --region us-east-2
   ```
3. Update Lambda to set `magicLinkSent: true` ONLY after email actually sends
4. Test by actually checking the practice email inbox

## üéâ BOTTOM LINE

**Magic links are the SECRET SAUCE that makes this CRM valuable.**

Without them, it's just a glorified contact form.

With them, we go from **rep pitch ‚Üí practice onboarded** in minutes instead of days.

**That's why we need the email to actually send.** üöÄ

## üìû NEXT STEP

**Backend Team:** 
1. Verify `noreply@curagenesis.com` in SES (us-east-2)
2. Test the email actually sends
3. Check practice inbox to confirm receipt
4. Share screenshot of received email

Once email works, the entire flow is complete!
